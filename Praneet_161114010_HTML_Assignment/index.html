                <div class="description line-1"> * TCP/IP, or the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP can also be used as a communications protocol in a private network (an intranet or an extranet).</div>
                <div class="description line-2"> * The entire internet protocol suite -- a set of rules and procedures -- is commonly referred to as TCP/IP, though others are included in the suite.</div>
                <div class="description line-3"> * TCP/IP specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end communications that identify how it should be broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination. </div>
                <div class="description line-4"> * The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the research branch of the U.S. Department of Defense, created the TCP/IP model in the 1970s for use in ARPANET, a wide area network that preceded the internet.</div>
                <div class="description line-5"> * TCP/IP was originally designed for the Unix operating system, and it has been built into all of the operating systems that came after it. The TCP/IP model and its related protocols are now maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force.</div>
                <div class="description line-6"> * TCP/IP uses the client/server model of communication in which a user or machine (a client) is provided a service (like sending a webpage) by another computer (a server) in the network.</div>
                <div class="description line-7"> * TCP/IP either combines several OSI layers into a single layer, or does not use certain layers at all. The following table shows the layers of the Solaris implementation of TCP/IP. </div>
                <div class="description line-8"> * Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP). It is one of the core protocols of standards-based internetworking methods in the Internet, and was the first version deployed for production in the ARPANET in 1983.</div>
                <div class="description line-9"> * Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. </div>
